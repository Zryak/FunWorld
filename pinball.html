      <div class="a">Pinball games are a family of games in which a ball is propelled into a specially designed table where it bounces off various 
        obstacles, scoring points either en route or when it comes to rest. Historically the board was studded with nails called 'pins' and had hollows 
        or pockets which scored points if the ball came to rest in them. Today, pinball is most commonly an arcade game in which the ball is fired into 
        a specially designed cabinet known as a pinball machine, hitting various lights, bumpers, ramps, and other targets depending on its design. The 
        game's object is generally to score as many points as possible by hitting these targets and making various shots with flippers before the ball 
        is lost. Most pinball machines use one ball per turn (except during special multi-ball phases), and the game ends when the ball(s) from the last 
        turn are lost. The biggest pinball machine manufacturers historically include Bally Manufacturing, Gottlieb, Williams Electronics and Stern 
        Pinball.</div>
