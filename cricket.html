      <div class="a"> Ah, summer: the sound of leather on willow, and the spectacle of cricket ... cricket! As the 
        tournament begins in the Oval cricket ground, something buzzes outside. A team of crickets sans tickets have 
        set up their own wickets for a game of pest cricket! As they face their archrivals, the snails, it’s sure to be 
        a match for the centuries. Don’t be fooled by their sluggish looks — these fielders can be fast on their feet!

To celebrate the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, we’re inviting everyone to tap/click and take a swing at our pocket-size game!

We know that cricket is loved worldwide, so we wanted to make sure our Doodle works for everyone, including those on slower 
        mobile networks. We kept the file size fly-sized, and the result is our smallest interactive Doodle ever — even 
        snail networks can load it in seconds.

Whether you're enjoying the tournament at a snail’s pace or bowling faster than the beat of a hummingbird's wings, 
        here's hoping you hit it out of the park this summer!
