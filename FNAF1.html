      <p style:"margin:20%">Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF) is a 2014 point-and-click survival horror game developed and published by Scott Cawthon. 
        The player takes on the role of Mike Schmidt, a night security guard at a family pizzeria. Schmidt must complete his shifts without being 
        confronted by the homicidal animatronic characters that wander the restaurant at night. The player has access to security cameras to monitor
        the animatronics throughout the shift, and a set of steel doors that can lock out the characters. Using the cameras and doors consumes the 
        player's limited electricity, and draining all of the power causes these tools to become inoperable.</p>
