      <p style="margin:20%">Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a 
        chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, 
        two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. 
        threatening it with inescapable capture. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>
