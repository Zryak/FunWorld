      <p style="margin:20%"> The players in the game represent settlers establishing settlements on the fictional island of Catan. Players build 
        settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island. The game board, which represents the island, is composed of 
        hexagonal tiles (hexes) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game. Newer editions of the game 
        began to depict a fixed layout in their manual, which has been proved by computer simulations to be fairly even-handed, and recommend this 
        to be used by beginners. In 2016, editions of the game were released with a conventional fixed layout board in this configuration, the 
        hexes of which cannot be rearranged.
