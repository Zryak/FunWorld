      <div class="a">Development of Celeste began in August 2015, when game developers Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry participated in a game jam, 
        where they created Celeste for the PICO-8. Thorson, who served as producer, and Berry, who served as the lead programmer, wanted to expand the 
        PICO-8 game into a full release. Inspired in part by Thorson's own TowerFall (2013) and by Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988), the gameplay was designed 
        to be minimal, while mirroring Thorson's experiences with bouldering. Celeste was designed to be accessible, featuring game mechanics intended 
        to make the game more forgiving in addition to an "Assist Mode" offering several options to make the game less challenging. The themes of 
        self-forgiveness present in the narrative began with the idea of creating a "more introspective" game, and later grew to become intertwined 
        with the gameplay. The soundtrack was composed by Lena Raine.</div>
