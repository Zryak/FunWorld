      <p>Retro Bowl emulates the gameplay of American football and was heavily influenced by the Tecmo Bowl series. In Retro Bowl, 
the player controls the team's offense while also acting as the team's general manager. Even though the player can draft defensive players or get 
defensive players from free agency, the defense is not playable, and is simulated by the game. The goal of the game is for the player to manage their 
team to the Retro Bowl championship game (A spin-off of the Super Bowl). The game also includes aspects of managing an American football team such as 
trading and cutting players, signing free agents, maintaining morale, drafting players, talking to the press, and more. There is also, for $1 only, an 
"unlimited version" which gives access to editing any team's uniforms, logos, names and end zones, weather, and more. The player can also buy Retro Bowl's 
currency called coaching credits, which can also be earned by game play and decisions outside of the game. All teams are based on the NFL teams in real 
life, but since EA still has the exclusive NFL license to the actual teams and players, Retro Bowl makes a similar jersey to the team, and puts the city's 
name instead of the team's name to make up for the lack of NFL license. (For example, Philadelphia instead of the Philadelphia Eagles.)</p>
